# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

This is my attempt at refactoring code to create a MERN book search engine. This was very challenging, but worthwhile to debug and use the knowledge I have gained throughout this program. I found it very difficult to change the existing code to make it all link up and run correctly. I was able to critically think and work through errors in order to refactor the code. I have not been able to deploy via Heroku but will keep troubleshooting in order to deploy. 

## Installation

Download the repository and run NPM i in the terminal. 

## Usage

Run NPM start to view the application.
